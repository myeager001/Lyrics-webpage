  <h1>The Beatles Lyrics</h1>
  <h2>"In My Life"</h2>
  <p>
    There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    In my life I love you more
  </p>
